## Description 
Signature Verificaiton and Identification Studio uses the following algorithms: 
- Siamese Netowrk that takes a genuine, labeled signature and an input signature to determine whether the input signature is forged or genuine.
- CNN architecture that takes an input signature of a person who already being trained on his data "24 ginuine and 24 forged signature" and the model predicts whether the input signature is ginuine or forged.
- CNN architecture to predict the label and the corresponding user of the input signature. 

## Features 
- User can browse images from his pc.
- The project contains 3 tabs:
  - First Tab  -> Signature Verificaiton using Siamese Network.
  - Second Tab -> Signature Verificaiton using Convolution Neural Network.
  - Third Tab -> Signature IDentification using AlexNet implemented by us.

## Technology Used:
The Desktop Application is built using:
- PyQt6 Creator.
- OpenCV Library.
- SVM machine learning model.
- Convolution Neural Network.
- Siamese Network
- TensorFlow and Keras
